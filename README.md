## Ciao, I'm Francesco 👋

I’ve been building web and mobile products since 2016, with a particular love for SaaS, tight feedback loops and real customer impact.

**🔧 Main toolkit:** TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL  
**🧠 Interests:** product-driven teams, real-time collaboration systems
**🪦 Fun fact:** I co-built EngagementBuilder and grew it to 30K+ ARR in 9 months… right before Twitter took its API from $0 to $42K/month. RIP.

**🌊 When I’m not coding:**  
- If the wind’s up → windsurfing in the open sea  
- If it’s down → climbing or hacking on a side project
